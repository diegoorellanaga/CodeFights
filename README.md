# CodeFights
just some code I made playing around in codefights

# Code1.py

This code implements a function that receives an array and returns the maximum length of a sub continuous array of this array that is a zigzag array. 

## what is a zigzag array

a zigzag array is an array in which the two neighbors of each element is strictly bigger or strictly smaller.
