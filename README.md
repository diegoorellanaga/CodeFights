# CodeFights
just some code I made playing around in codefights

#Time tests#
## Code1.py

This code implements a function that receives an array and returns the maximum length of a sub continuous array of this array that is a zigzag array. 

### what is a zigzag array

a zigzag array is an array in which the two neighbors of each element is strictly bigger or strictly smaller.

## Code2.py

This code implements a function to calculate the smaller period of a periodicall sequence.

Where **max_period** is the maximun period you want to look for, and **test_numb** is how many numbers of the sequence you want to test, the bigger the better but you have to make max_period+test_numb < len(sequence)

## Code3.py

This code implements a function to solve the Boggle game. Is just a brute force search of words in a 2d array.

wordBoggle is the main function and it has 2 parameters; board and words

* **board:** is a 2d list containing letters.
* **words:** is a list of words that we want to find in the board following Boggle rules.

## Code4.py

This script contains the 4 first tests for the arrays section
